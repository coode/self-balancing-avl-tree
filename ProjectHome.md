Provides concatenate and split operations plus the usual: add, delete, search, min, max, deletemin, deletemax .. (all logarithmic time)

Can be easily ported to C++.

Can be used with or without parent pointers/references (refer to TREE\_WITH\_PARENT\_POINTERS directive in the source code). Traversal is currently implemented using parent pointers. Sorted dictionaries (map and multimap) .NET collection classes are also provided.
